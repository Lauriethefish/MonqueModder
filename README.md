# Quatcher

Quatcher is a WIP GUI based mod installer for any il2cpp unity app on the Oculus Quest.
It was originally created for modding GorillaTag.

It should support Windows, Mac and Linux.

It uses Sc2ad's [QuestLoader](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestLoader/) for loading mods and is based mostly on RedBrumbler's [CLI Tool](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestAppPatcher).

Currently it isn't released, as several more things still need to be added:

See `MOD_FORMAT.md` for instructions about making a mod that is loadable by this patcher.

## TODO
- Improve GUI perhaps
